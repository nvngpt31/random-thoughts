Nichiren Buddhism is **both the same and different** from other forms of Buddhism - it's a distinct school within the broader Buddhist tradition. Let me break this down:

## **How It's the SAME as Buddhism:**

### **Core Buddhist Foundations:**
- Accepts the **Four Noble Truths** (suffering, its cause, its cessation, the path)
- Recognizes the **Three Jewels** (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha)
- Believes in **karma** and **rebirth**
- Aims for **enlightenment** and liberation from suffering
- Accepts **impermanence** and **interdependence**
- Venerates **Shakyamuni Buddha** as the historical founder

### **Basic Buddhist Concepts:**
- The cycle of samsara (birth, death, rebirth)
- The goal of achieving Buddhahood
- Compassion and wisdom as essential qualities
- The importance of ethical conduct

## **How It's DIFFERENT from Other Buddhism:**

### **Unique Characteristics of Nichiren Buddhism:**

#### **1. Central Focus on the Lotus Sutra**
- Believes the **Lotus Sutra** contains Buddha's ultimate teaching
- Views other sutras as preparatory or provisional
- Claims the Lotus Sutra reveals that **all people can achieve Buddhahood**

#### **2. The Practice of Chanting**
- Primary practice: chanting **"Nam-myoho-renge-kyo"**
- This phrase means "devotion to the Mystic Law of the Lotus Sutra"
- Belief that chanting this phrase can lead directly to enlightenment

#### **3. The Gohonzon**
- Uses a mandala called the **Gohonzon** as object of devotion
- Contains names of buddhas, bodhisattvas, and the central phrase
- Represents the enlightened life state within each person

#### **4. Founder and Timeline**
- Founded by **Nichiren Daishonin** (1222-1282) in Japan
- Much newer than other major Buddhist schools
- Developed in medieval Japan with strong Japanese cultural influences

#### **5. Approach to Practice**
- **Simpler practice**: Primarily chanting rather than complex meditation
- **This-world focus**: Emphasizes solving problems in daily life
- **Lay-oriented**: Designed for householders, not just monks

#### **6. Theological Differences**
- **Eternal Buddha**: Views Shakyamuni as manifestation of eternal Buddha
- **Direct path**: Claims immediate access to Buddhahood through chanting
- **Exclusive truth**: Some branches claim superiority over other Buddhist schools

## **Major Nichiren Schools Today:**

### **Soka Gakkai International (SGI)**
- Largest and most well-known Nichiren organization globally
- Lay Buddhist organization (no clergy)
- Emphasizes world peace and cultural activities
- Founded by Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, led by Daisaku Ikeda

### **Nichiren Shoshu**
- Priestly organization
- More traditional and conservative
- Formerly associated with SGI until 1991 split

### **Other Nichiren Schools:**

## **Controversies and Criticisms:**

### **Within Buddhism:**

- Debate over whether simplified practice maintains Buddhist essence
- Tension between **devotional** vs. **meditative** approaches

### **Scholarly Perspectives:**

- Noted for successful **modernization** and **globalization**
- Sometimes criticized for **departing from traditional Buddhist meditation**

### **Relationship to Traditional Buddhism:**
- **Maintains core Buddhist worldview** (karma, rebirth, suffering, enlightenment)
- **Adapts Buddhist practice** for modern, lay-centered lifestyle
- **Emphasizes different aspects** - devotion over meditation, this-world over otherworldly
- **Cultural adaptation** - heavily influenced by Japanese history and values

## **Key Theological Debates:**

### **Within Nichiren Community:**
- **Orthodoxy disputes** between different Nichiren schools
- **Role of priesthood** vs. lay leadership
- **Interpretation of Nichiren's teachings** and writings
- **Political involvement** - some groups very active, others avoid politics

### **With Broader Buddhism:**
- **Exclusivity claims** - some Nichiren groups claim superiority
- **Simplification concerns** - whether chanting alone is sufficient Buddhist practice
- **Modernization vs. tradition** - balancing ancient wisdom with contemporary relevance

## **Practical Differences in Daily Practice:**

### **Nichiren Buddhist Daily Practice:**
- **Morning/evening chanting** of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
- **Study** of Nichiren's writings and Lotus Sutra
- **Discussion meetings** with other practitioners
- **Application** of Buddhist principles to daily challenges
- **Cultural activities** (especially in SGI)

### **Compared to Other Buddhist Practice:**
- **Less meditation** than Zen or Vipassana traditions

## **Modern Global Impact:**

### **Positive Contributions:**
- **Peace activism** and nuclear disarmament advocacy
- **Educational institutions** worldwide
- **Cultural exchange** programs
- **Interfaith dialogue** initiatives
- **Environmental awareness** campaigns

### **Growth and Adaptation:**

- Adapted to diverse cultural contexts
- Maintains Japanese organizational elements while localizing practice
- Appeals to modern practitioners seeking practical spirituality

## **Conclusion:**

**Nichiren Buddhism IS Buddhism** - it shares the fundamental Buddhist worldview, goals, and ethical framework. However, it represents a **distinctive interpretation and practice** that differs significantly from other Buddhist schools in:

- **Method** (chanting vs. meditation)
- **Focus** (this-world benefits vs. otherworldly liberation)
- **Accessibility** (simplified practice vs. complex training)
- **Organization** (lay-centered vs. monastic)

The relationship is similar to how **Protestant Christianity** relates to **Christianity** overall - same core religion, but with significant theological and practical differences that create distinct religious experiences.

Whether you consider it "the same" or "different" often depends on:
- Your definition of "authentic" Buddhism
- Which aspects you emphasize (doctrine vs. practice)
- Your perspective on religious evolution and adaptation

Most Buddhist scholars accept Nichiren Buddhism as a legitimate Buddhist school, while acknowledging its unique characteristics and sometimes controversial claims.
