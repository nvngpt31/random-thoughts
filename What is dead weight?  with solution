"Dead weight" refers to individuals or factors that hinder progress, drain resources, or fail to contribute positively to a situation. This concept can apply to both personal relationships and corporate environments, where the presence of dead weight can create imbalances and lead to dissatisfaction or inefficiency.

### In Relationships

You may become "dead weight" in a relationship when:

1. Lack of Engagement:

3. Dependence:  
   - Signs: You rely heavily on your partner for emotional support, decision-making, or even daily tasks, without contributing your share.
   - Impact: This can lead to resentment, as your partner may feel overburdened and unsupported.

4. Avoidance of Responsibility:
