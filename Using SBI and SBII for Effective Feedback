Using SBI and SBII for Effective Feedback

1. Situation
Identify and clearly describe the specific situation where the behavior took place, including time and place details to avoid ambiguity. For example, “During yesterday’s 11 am team meeting…” This sets the context and helps the recipient recall the exact moment of the behavior.

2. Behavior
Describe the actual behavior observed in factual terms, avoiding personal judgments or assumptions. Use neutral language to keep the conversation constructive. For example, “You interrupted me while I was presenting” instead of “You were rude.” This focuses on what was done, not who the person is.

3. Impact
Explain the effect the behavior had on you, the team, or the organization, including emotional or practical consequences. Be honest but non-judgmental, describing how it made you feel or what happened as a result. For example, “I felt frustrated because it broke my concentration” or “It delayed the meeting agenda.”

4. Intent (Extending to SBII)
After you’ve shared the situation, behavior, and impact, invite the other person to explain their intention behind the behavior. Ask questions like, “What were you hoping to achieve?” or “Can you share what was going on for you at that moment?” This opens a two-way conversation, helps clarify misunderstandings, and builds trust by exploring the gap between intent and impact.

Benefits
Reduces anxiety and defensiveness by focusing on observable facts and personal impact rather than assumptions or blame.

Encourages more frequent, actionable, and clear feedback that enhances development and performance.

Builds psychological safety by fostering open communication and mutual understanding.

Turns feedback into coaching conversations, leading to more positive outcomes and stronger relationships.

Practical Tips
Prepare feedback by noting the specific situation, behavior, and impact before the conversation.

Give feedback promptly, but wait for emotions to settle if needed.

Use “I” statements to center on your perspective and avoid accusatory language.

Actively listen when inquiring about intent and be open to explanations.

Use the SBI/SBII method in diverse contexts—team meetings, one-on-ones, performance reviews, or conflict resolution.

This structured, empathetic approach to feedback strengthens communication effectiveness by aligning perceived impact with intended meaning, making it invaluable for leadership and teamwork.​
