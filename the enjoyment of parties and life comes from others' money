The statement "The enjoyment of parties, life, or any other enjoyment comes from others' money" can be examined from various perspectives. While it holds some truth, it also warrants a deeper exploration of the nature of enjoyment and social interactions. Here’s a detailed explanation:

### 1. Social Enjoyment and Shared Experiences
   - Community Engagement: Many social gatherings, such as parties, are often hosted by friends or family. When others financially support these events, it allows everyone to participate without the burden of costs. This shared experience can enhance enjoyment and foster stronger relationships.
   - Collective Joy: When a group comes together, the joy often multiplies. Enjoying an event that someone else has organized can create a sense of community and belonging, which is inherently satisfying.

### 2. Financial Relief
   - Reduced Stress: When others fund an event, individuals can relax and fully engage without worrying about expenses. This financial relief can lead to a more enjoyable experience, as people are free to socialize and celebrate.
   - Access to Opportunities: Events funded by others can provide access to experiences that might otherwise be unaffordable, allowing individuals to enjoy life in ways they might not be able to on their own.

### 3. The Role of Generosity
   - Spirit of Giving: The enjoyment derived from events often stems from the generosity of the host. This generosity can create a warm and inviting atmosphere that enhances the overall experience for everyone involved.
   - Cultural and Social Norms: In many cultures, hosting and treating others is a way of expressing care and building connections. The act of spending money on others can add to the enjoyment of the event.

### 4. Intrinsic Sources of Enjoyment
   - Personal Fulfillment: Enjoyment does not solely depend on external funding. Many people find joy in simple, everyday experiences that don’t require money, such as spending time with loved ones, engaging in hobbies, or enjoying nature.
   - Self-Generated Joy: Personal happiness and fulfillment can come from within, through achievements, personal growth, and meaningful connections. This shows that while money can facilitate enjoyment, it is not the only source.

### 5. Balance and Perspective
   - Dependency on Others: Relying solely on others for enjoyment can lead to a lack of independence and self-sufficiency. It’s important to cultivate personal sources of joy and fulfillment.
   - Value of Experiences: Ultimately, the richness of life often comes from experiences, relationships, and personal growth rather than purely financial means.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, while it is true that the enjoyment of parties and various life experiences can be enhanced by others' financial contributions, it is essential to recognize that true enjoyment often arises from relationships, shared moments, and personal fulfillment. Balancing external support with internal sources of happiness can lead to a more fulfilling and enriched life.
