# Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - Complete Step-by-Step Guide

## Understanding CBT: The Foundation

### What is CBT?
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a structured, goal-oriented form of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It's based on the principle that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected.

The CBT Triangle:
    THOUGHTS
       ↗ ↖
      ↙   ↘
FEELINGS ↔ BEHAVIORS

## Phase 1: Understanding the CBT Model

### Step 1: Learn the Core Concepts

Key CBT Principles:
1. Thoughts influence feelings and behaviors
2. Patterns can be identified and changed
3. Present-focused approach
4. Collaborative and active process
5. Skills-based and practical

Exercise 1.1: Identifying the Triangle
Think of a recent situation that upset you. Complete this:

Situation: _________________________________
Thought: ___________________________________
Feeling: ___________________________________
Behavior: __________________________________

Example:
- Situation: Boss criticized my presentation
- Thought: "I'm terrible at my job"
- Feeling: Anxious, sad
- Behavior: Avoided boss for rest of week

### Step 2: Understanding Cognitive Distortions

Common Thinking Errors:

1. All-or-Nothing Thinking
   - Example: "If I'm not perfect, I'm a failure"

2. Mental Filter
   - Example: Focusing only on negative feedback, ignoring positive

3. Mind Reading
   - Example: "Everyone thinks I'm boring"

4. Fortune Telling
   - Example: "This presentation will be a disaster"

5. Catastrophizing
   - Example: "If I fail this test, my life is ruined"

Exercise 1.2: Spotting Distortions
For each thought, identify the distortion:

1. "I always mess everything up" → ________________
2. "She didn't text back; she must hate me" → ________________
3. "I'll never find love" → ________________
4. "Everyone noticed my mistake" → ________________
5. "If I don't get this job, I'm worthless" → ________________

Answers: 1) All-or-nothing, 2) Mind reading, 3) Fortune telling, 4) Mind reading, 5) Catastrophizing


## Phase 2: Core CBT Techniques

### Step 3: Thought Records

The 7-Column Thought Record:

| Date/Time | Situation | Emotion(s) | Automatic Thought | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Balanced Thought |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
|           |           | (0-100)    |                   |              |                  |                  |

Exercise 2.1: Complete Thought Record
Use a current concern:

Example:
| Date/Time | Situation | Emotion(s) | Automatic Thought | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Balanced Thought |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Mon 3pm | Friend cancelled plans | Disappointed (70), Angry (50) | "She doesn't care about me" | She's cancelled twice this month | She always apologizes, reschedules, had family emergency | "She cares but has other priorities sometimes" |

### Step 4: Behavioral Experiments

Purpose: Test the accuracy of negative predictions through action.

Steps:
1. Identify the negative prediction
2. Rate confidence in prediction (0-100%)
3. Design experiment to test it
4. Carry out experiment
5. Record actual outcome
6. Re-rate confidence in original prediction

Exercise 2.2: Design a Behavioral Experiment

Negative Prediction: "If I speak up in the meeting, everyone will think I'm stupid"

Confidence Level: ____/100

Experiment Design: _________________________________

Predicted Outcome: _________________________________

Actual Outcome: ___________________________________

New Confidence Level: ____/100

### Step 5: Activity Scheduling and Behavioral Activation

For Depression and Low Motivation:

Exercise 2.3: Weekly Activity Schedule
Rate each activity for Pleasure (P) and Mastery (M) on a scale of 0-10.

Weekly Schedule Template:

| Time | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 7-8am |       |         |           |         |         |           |         |
| 8-9am | | | | | | | |
| 9-10am | | | | | | | |

| 6-7pm | | | | | | | |
| 7-8pm | | | | | | | |
| 8-9pm | | | | | | | |
| 9-10pm | | | | | | | |

Instructions:
1. Fill in your current activities
2. Rate each: P=Pleasure (0-10), M=Mastery/Achievement (0-10)
3. Identify patterns of low P/M activities
4. Schedule new activities with higher P/M potential

Example Entry:
- "Exercise (P=7, M=8)"
- "Coffee with friend (P=9, M=3)"
- "Work project (P=4, M=7)"

Exercise 2.4: Behavioral Activation Plan
